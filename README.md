### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a research scientist interested in bioinformatics, bioimage analysis and data science.

I previously developed:
1) [clonedetective](https://morriso1.github.io/clonedetective/) - a python library for automated cell lineage analysis.
2) [ratioimage](https://morriso1.github.io/ratioimage/) - a python library for the quantification of ratiometric imaging data.
<!--
**morriso1/morriso1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
